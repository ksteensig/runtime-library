# runtime-library
This is a round-robin scheduled, co-operative, M:N thread library written in C.

* Round-robin: Each thread is served as first come first served.
* co-operative: Tasks have to yield themselves, they are not preemptive scheduled.
* M:N threads: M lightweight threads (in this library tasks) scheduled on N POSIX threads.

This library is used by creating a lot of (N) tasks and then they are scheduled on top of a specified amount (M) POSIX threads. This should reduce the overhead of context switching, as the kernel isn't entered to make the switch.

## API

The library has an entry procedure called *rmain* for _run-time main_. *rmain* takes two parameters: *os_thread_count* and *initial*. The first argument is how many POSIX threads you want to create (I usually create as many as the amount of CPU cores I have). The second argument is the initial task (entry task) where from other subtasks can be spawned.

```c
void rmain(uint64_t os_thread_count, task_t *initial)
```

To create a task there are two different functions that can be used. The first one is *taskcreate* which takes to arguments. The first argument is a function pointer to the procedure which the task should run. The second argument is a void pointer to the argument for the procedure. There can only be given one argument, so if you wish to pass multiple values to the procedure, then you have to wrap them in a struct. The procedure cannot return any values either, so the struct wrapping the parameters also has to be used for output parameters of the procedure.


```c
task_t *taskcreate(void (*fn)(void*), void *arg)
task_t *taskalloc(void (*fn)(void*), void *arg, uint stack)
```

```c

```
